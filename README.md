# React-Portfolio-JAG
My personal portfolio site built with react.

## Description

This is my personal portfolio site built using react. The site is based off of my older portfolio [site](https://github.com/Exo-MDR-CD2000/week-2-draft-portfolio-site) which I quite like still. The layout is more or less the same as my original site but it's now a single page react site with dynamic navigation tabs. There are still a few wrinkles to iron out such as adding more CSS styling rules, implementing a working contact form with a back-end, and adding a pdf viewer in the browser. The site has all the basics that a portfolio site needs like a header, navbar, projects, and a footer.
